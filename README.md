# Your First HTML Tag Lab

## Learning Goals

- Code the first 'div'with 3 containers.
- code the second 'div' with 2 containers
- code the third 'div' which is the footer

## Introduction

So far, we have a picture in our minds of how our portfolio
looks like.

## Getting Started

**Fork and clone** this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code. Run `npm test` as you go to see your test progress.

## Code the header

This is where we introduce the first div for the body,so that we can introduce nav which has a title links and a logo.Now we have completed the header!

## Set the Inner Text

We create another div for the body and so we need two nav,one that talks more about the portfolio and the other nav contains an image for the owner of the portfolio.

### Viewing Your Work in the Browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your
browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual
layout in the browser.

You can open `index.html` a few ways, depending on the environment you are in:

For Mac users:

- Open from the Terminal by running `open index.html` in the root directory of
  this lab
- Use Finder to navigate to this lab's local folder and click the `index.html`
  file

For WSL users:

- Open from Ubuntu by running `explorer.exe index.html` in the root directory of
  this lab
- Open a new Explorer window. There is a bar that says "Quick Access" along the
  top of the window (similar to a URL bar in a browser). Click this and type
  `\\wsl$` to access files and folders on Ubuntu. Navigate to
  `/home/<your-user-name>/` to get to your home directory, then locate this
  lab's local folder and click the `index.html` file.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it
in a text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the
changes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have created your own portfolio. Remember to submit your
work in CodeGrade before moving on.
